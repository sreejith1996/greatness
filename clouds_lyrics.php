					<h3>Verse 1:</h3>
					I see humanity in the clouds, and its staring me down but, they all watch the clock keep tickin, the song keeps ringing as the end of the hour comes/ I watch as they mould into stories/ Somehow, they never seem to bore me, giving my questions all of a thought, some of these answers I ponder upon/ just/ how little we are/ livinit large, we&#39;ll be gone in the long run, but, how long is the long run? Think a little deep and I figure it&#39;s a short one// Never think twice to be so careless, who we wouldn&#39;t hurt for a price tag// Drove a species to extinction, damage our whole circle of life/ damn//
					<br /><br />
					<h3>Hook:</h3>
					And I think about it everyday/ If I can make a bit of a change/
					All I have to do is better my ways/ But nobody cares, cuz nobodysthere//
					And if the Clouds were to fall tomorrow/
					Could I pray for some time I could borrow?/
					Ill peek space every nook every hollow/
					What if the clouds were to fall tomorrow?//
					<br /><br />

					<h3>Verse 2:</h3>
					I see humanity in the clouds, and its staring me down but, they all watch the clock keep tickin, the song keeps ringing as the end of the hour comes/ shit, and the guilt as I write this cuz Ivebeen known to be wrecklesstoo/ but Ivelearnt from these mistakes, if this is new to me, its redemption too// Ill do my bit, earn a difference/ acts of good heal the world that we livinin/ corporates concerned with dividends, disasters we inflict are evident/ end of the world is imminent, watch as the sky breaks down, ground erodes to bits// Push those gears of time, years down the line our kids don&#39;t exist//
					<br /><br />

										<h3>Verse 3:</h3>
					I see no trees at all/ energy that isn&#39;t feasible/ the means are hard, lookinaround enemies at war// Politics as usual, whosto call with who&#39;s regard// Livinin this clueless world where the colorof your skin decides who ya are// livinthis incidental lifestyle/ for some, the internet is life now// really wouldn&#39;t care if my car go crash, long as I can update my smartphone app/ who&#39;s my favourite cousin how would I know that? 140 characters, I know that// and I keep falling till I&#39;m down and out/
					I used to look up to the sky but now the clouds are gone..//
