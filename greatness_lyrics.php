					<h3>Verse 1:</h3>
					It was all a dream/ and this one I wont wake up from// Let me be upfront of where I come from/ Mom and Dad they some working class heroes, but now is My time/ watch ya son as he grows// Cuz I still remember one of My best days/ That CD player yall copped for my birthday/ call my bestfriend, get the CD&#39;s andale// You know that first rush you get when you press play?/ You ever notice in a moment how your life change? In a moment you wont know it you just go insane/ searchinfor some peace but in the end all you gets pain, but every “knight takes an L”/ this shits a “chess game”// Funny to kill a beat you gottabreak the loop/ break some hearts break the bank and then break the roof/ never build yourself on whatever they make of you/ to say the truth pride is something they cant take from you// 2 years I been working on this album/ nothing else matters all they notice is the outcome// you wouldn&#39;t understand the hardworkbehind it, if you lookinfor some greatness, get on your feet and find it//
					<br /><br />
					<h3>Hook:</h3>
					With My feet on the ground/ My eyes to the sky/
					LivinMy dreams till the day I die/
					Every day is a lesson/ Thank God I&#39;m Alive/
					If you feelinMy vibe put your hands up/ high/
					And I wont stop reaching for Greatness//
					Done with being good, now I&#39;m pushing for Greatness//
					People spend they whole lives lookinfor Greatness//
					And I&#39;m proud to be Me/ My destiny is My Greatness//		
					<br /><br />									
					<h3>Verse 2:</h3>
					This gonbe the realest shit I ever wrote/ but will it be the realest shit that you ever quote/ behind the scenes is a man you will never know, cuz behind the scenes is a story that was never told// all these late nights and missed classes/ I never been a part of fights this massive/ can you imagine? Close friends go distant, and the ones you love, act a little different/ everyone else wonders where you went missing/ you in the bedroom thinkinyou can make a difference// Ink on your fingertips, writing in ya notebook, give the world up for a sick verse and a dope hook/ I set expectations to surpass mine, this is not a hobby, this is not a pastime// I&#39;m trynna be remembered, trynna leave a legacy, not trynna be a memory in the December breeze/ so when you say I cant jump no higher, or when I see the truth through the lips of a liar/ said My passion would never match my desire/ all I believed was you adding fuel to the fire//
