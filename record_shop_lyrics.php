				I&#39;m not going home today/ Its time I stopped by to check the record shop// And listen to the songs they play/And then I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll go ahead and wreck the shop//I stopped listening to the radio/ But then again that was some time ago// I&#39;m not going home today// Its time I stopped by to check the Record Shop//

				<br /><br />

				<h3>Verse 1:</h3><br />
				These earpods have blocked the noises from a thousand voices&#44; I've hoisted a flag against mere annoyance/ Many a people have tried to envoy it but could never meet the ends on directions they&#39;ve appointed its/ kind of/ strange&#44; I have&#44; played/ on fields of thorned soil&#44; bleeding over the wrong choice// what&#39;s disappointing is that I get pointed on&#44; what's mercy is I do not diss em even when I&#39;m on point// The vision is wrong&#44; the monocle is see through&#44; I&#39;m easily me&#44; its hard for you to be you&#44; harder to believe you/ given you a choice who would you be? P-J-2-3? Me too/ For those who laughed at Justis/ For those that passed judgement&#44; I grow everyday so fuck what the past judge meant&#44; I&#39;m presently in the future so I&#39;m past past judgement//
				Now let me talk to em one bit&#44; Hip-Hop is not about the bitches you have gotten drunk with/ Not the swag&#44; the trukfits&#44; the message&#44; you uplift&#44; to downgrade these young kids&#44; ironically I&#39;m redundant&#44; the skill is in abundance&#44; the mirror you confront with is fake&#44; its frontin/ this the shit that you come up with? Then I&#39;m sorry Mr. dumbshit&#44; the only thing you&#39;ve accomplished&#44; since you jumped into &#39; hip-hop&#39; is a &#39; dumb skip&#39;//

					<h3>Verse 2:</h3><br />
					Why should I spit these next lines? If they don&#39;t make it to the headlines, if they don&#39;t let me headline a gig before a deadline, Ill line em up, and dead everybody&#39;s headline/ simple as that/ it&#39;s the simplest fact//
					The ones who bark a lot, write the simplest crap, sometimes I wish you were like yarecords, I&#39;d grip you to death, so when you break under pressure you wont sink through the cracks, cuz sometimes, when I listen to you I don&#39;t listen to rap, but fuck it//
					I&#39;m bussinon these percussions just cuz I love it, the rap standards whack bastards settinI&#39;m above it/ and I&#39;m hovering, but I spread an eye out to a Judas just incasethis meal is what my last supper is, but I&#39;m never last suppering, premonition game is hard/ &#39; blazinfup&#39; to &#39; liquor sessions&#39; and I&#39;m gon be &#39; flaminbars&#39;//

					<h3>Verse 3:</h3><br />
					You shoulda knew I am new school approved/ I am cool with the new and I stay true to the roots and you will never see this/ type of a heavenly mix/ rhyme with a blessedly gift/ writings this sensibly sick/ I hope zealously stick inside of your memory chips / and then endlessly rid you of your jealousy quick/ I tear melodies to bits homie if you were Me you&#39;d quit//
					Cuz what do you know? About music that sooths souls, ask me about it tell you how the flute that you toot go/ routes that these roots go, shoot with these brute flows, if this music lives with you, carry it to your tombstone//
					If this music lives with you, carry it to your tombstone//
