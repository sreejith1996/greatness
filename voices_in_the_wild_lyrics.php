										<h3>Verse 1:</h3>
					I try to dive into my efforts, Find just what makes me special, There's a pulse inside my mental, In my flesh I'm the essential, And the rain is just the start, The Lightning rides a thunderbolt, The party never stops as I watch all of em come and go, I've seen you fall to drugs, I've seen you misinterpret, You've seen me fall in love, When the meaning isn't perfect, I've been pushed and I've bin shoved, I've been judged just like the masses, Plus they thought they'd burn me down, Watched as I rose up from the ashes, I'm a Phoenix I'm a king, Spread my wings you won't believe it, I fly over Yall opinions, Most of which I disagree with, Yeah I'm not a normal person you won't find me in a crowd, All of em try to hunt you down in your pursuit to earn that crown//
					
					<br /><br />
					<h3>Hook:</h3>
					I hear the echoes all around/
					They save Me when I drown/
					There’s a curse over the grounds and I keep digging around/
					But there’s blessings in the skies/
					There’s a message in disguise/
					I hear them all the time/
					Voices In The Wild//
					<br />
					<br />


										<h3>Verse 2:</h3>
					There’s a voice inside of Me/There’s a voice inside of Me/ Even though I may be in hell it tells me to live wild and free I agree I am the only thing standing between I and Me/ Perception/ Mirrors I reflect in, don’t mirror my reflections/ I’m lost I need directions, walking through affections may get messy and infectious specially if there’s no exceptions/The quest for your acceptance might force you to blend in/ now wont you regret this? Yall trynna pose a threat then I’m trynna pose a question/ What? When? Where? How? Why die? And Why now? When I can fly high and sky glide cuz My shine don’t lights out/ are you in the vibe with me though? Do you kill the time with ego? Now synchronize with these flows, listen//

					<h3>Verse 3:</h3>
					I'm fightin fire with iron, its like I'm constantly trying to spark conversations in silence with the way that I'm writing/ You spill my guts when you smile for Me/ So your reward is food for thought/ every bite is for your eyes to feast but silently cuz// Juveniles actin wild/ I'm just trynna figure out what happens if I run matchsticks through a plastic smile// but don’t fear me, yeah you can come swim near me, and we can go steer clean through these waters cuz I hear these//
