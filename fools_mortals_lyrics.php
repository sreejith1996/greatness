					<h3>Verse:</h3><br />
					I wouldn&#39;t let this through, Not usually in a rhyme, We&#39;re in disguise till our demise like all the time, How&#39;d you be true design, do you see through my eyes, your heart had been stolen, instead you borrowed mine.
					I&#39;m at the edge of a cliff leaping from a peak, what I didn&#39;t know on this mission I was stealing from a theif, 3 sides to astory but yo, just follow me as I reflect a part of me to show you what fools we mortals be
					It&#39;s quite some time ago, but it ain&#39;tway back, shouldaknown what never gave back shouldastayed back/ Used to be eager just to go and catch my train back Home, we used to hang around my place man/ Her eyes that drove me nuts, completely insane, mad, Swear she drove me crazy driver tell me where my lanes at/ Her lips are beautiful, she is what beauty be/ She been dealing with baggage, and I was duty free, it&#39;s kindacomplicated, him and her had some complications/ Ironic I found love, right in the middle of all this hatred, Careful with your wishes, might get more than you ask for/ She text you that she loves you but that&#39;s only at the airport//
					Shayad tu woh fizahai teer lagen ishaanope/ Beet gayetum jeet Gaye, mei jeeta tha ishaaroke/ Raastejo teri aankhonne, pal Mei he sajaayethe// Ladli mene khudse jang pyaark iss bahaanepe//
					Kya karli pyaar bewaja? Shurwatse thi tu bewafa, de diya sab kuch tujhko jo khudko kabhi na de saka Mei/ Yaari parchaise Teri tanhai ko gher rakha/ chote jazbaaton koin dono haathon Mei le chala Mei//
					Bhujadi amene ummeedk issaagko, milgai mujhko mere sawaaloka jawaabjo/ thaamli ya mere haathon Mei mene uske haathko//aagai roshni zindagi Mei ab tu Mera saath Chhod//
					<br /><br />

					<h3>Verse:</h3><br />
					Ab Kyu bhatku Mei, jab pyaar konadhundhna, baat meri maanapne yaar kotubhoolja, beet Gaye wohdin, jo jeeta tha tanhai Mei, Dil mera uth chala hai pyaar k issparchaise,
					pagalpanki haddtak jaa kar rakhte hai hum hausle// Par tere liye jee karab nadar tahu Mei mautse//
					I wouldn&#39;t let this through not usually in a rhyme, were in disguise till our demise like all the time/ How&#39;d I be true design? Do I see through your eyes? Maybe I shouldaknown baby there&#39;s 3// 3 sides to astory but yo just follow me as I reflect a part of me to show you what fools we mortals be/ It&#39;s quite some time ago but it ain&#39;tway back//
					I lost myself in lust prollynever wouldamade it back/ gave into that and later jumped right in the fatal trap it&#39;s unintentional but intensity was the same exact replica, I&#39;m losing ya you do more than I expect from ya, I&#39;m a fool cuz the more she does the less I think of her/ 3 sides to the story but don&#39;t never follow me as I reflect a part of me to show you what fools we mortals be//
					I lost the love of my life, loving you to death, do you regret the times we spent or would you rather refuse to tell? Oh well, can&#39;t all be Angels, but we could all be sinners, I used to live on broken promises I was just dishonest it&#39;s obvious/ we can&#39;t all be Angels, I broke out this circle even goddesses are out to hurt you homie, count your virtues and your blessings cuz sometimes they in disguises, strength isn&#39;t definite, and insecurities are indecisive/
					it&#39;s a lifeless world every time it&#39;s you and me/
					that&#39;s why I wrote you this song to
					show you what fools we mortals be//
