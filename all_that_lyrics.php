						<h3>Verse 1 [Keepsake]:</h3>
					Suno saarek-k-khole apne kaan, kyuki Keep kaverse hai aakhri/Iske baad, hone wala hai kya rahega kisi ko yaad nai/Jaise dia ehsaan koi/ jaise bana ho insaan koi/ jaise ban gaye ho khud bhagwaan(tum)/kare duniyaai jaadnai//
					Sach batau mujhe par wanah imei toh gulliyon mei ghumujan jaise gullike/ leke late efeinhaa jeene ke niche hum jeena hai seekheha bilkul kameeney/ha dil nichodey hum ladkey hai pagal/
					Gulli gulli jaaney Dill ise Dadar/ Mujhse aage badhkar milega kya? Thoda aage toh badh milunga Mei//
							<br /><br />
						<h3>Hook:</h3>
						I had to crawl before I learnt to walk/ I learnt to fly but first I had to fall/ they told me Id never make it at all/ they told Me I&#39;d never face an applause// Now they think I&#39;m never facinno hate/ now they think I&#39;m gonget faded away, Now they say I think I&#39;m really this great, but they just cant stop me from feeling this way cuz/
						Bitch I&#39;m All That/
						All that shit and more/
						I&#39;m just dreaminout loud I gottatalk my shit I&#39;m here to say
						Goodbye//
						Ay// Hi Haters
						Goodbye//
						Ay// Bye Haters
						<br /><br />

						<h3>Verse 2 [Poetik Justis]:</h3>
						They never thought that I&#39;d get where I&#39;m at/ They just saw me smokinpot layinback// Outside my college and that was the spot/ the squad is too turntup you with us or not/ I was just searchinfor inner peace, that was ever since I had enemies/ and in a sense my inner sense was innocence// Go figure bitch I&#39;m faded// I aint high on life, my lifeson a high level homie/ and yall flyinon kites, I&#39;m a kite in the sky and I&#39;m hungry/ Takin off I&#39;m like a scavenger, passengers wont you please hold on to your seats/ yall too concerned with dropping the world but what is the world when the world is at your feet?//
