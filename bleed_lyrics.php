						<h2>Verse 1:</h2><br />
						<p>5 o&#39;clock in the morning/ Wakinup and I&#39;m zonin/ 5 o&#39;clock in the morning/ Wakinup and I&#39;m zonin//5 o&#39;clock in the morning/Aint got no worthy opponents. The game is rough and its boring/Want me to save it up and I&#39;m on it like/ welcome to My world/
						Here&#39;s what my life is sortalike/ Why is it that I&#39;m ‘left&#39; with ‘chaos&#39;, everytimeI order right (oughtawrite)// Sweeping in and outta phases, fading in and outta life, just thinking bout the fam/ swearinthat Ill make em proud tonight/
						My music is for Me, but My music is for you, My musicsfor whoever knew that music is the truth, I mean I been really patient with this illness I bin sprayin/
						I bin layinlow, cookin up, mighta made utensils flip// The song don&#39;t need no censorship, I&#39;m flexible, I flex a bull, you flex a bit, so next up it&#39;s a mix of bits of textbook tips to get you to remember this//
						But I guess it&#39;s a wasted effort, cuz every time I school em, sceptics get so sensitive/ Do they really think hatred could help them up a win?
						How they gon hold shit down, not really knowing what they up against, trynna reroute my path, I wont follow I will live my dreams, I say what I wanna say don&#39;t really care what you think I mean//
						</p>
						<br /><br />

						<h2>Hook 1:</h2><br />
						<p>
						Chhoti Duniya Ke IssKone Pe Ek Chhota Sa Sheher Hai/ Sheher Ke Ek Kone Mei Ek Botal Mei Zeher Hai/
						Zeher Ko Tu Peele, Uss Sapne Ko Tu Jeele
						Zeher Ko Tu Peele, Uss Sapne Ko Tu Jeele
						</p>

						<br /><br />

						<h2>Verse 2:</h2><br />
						<p>And any other day it might just rattle your world/ to watch them play with what you say, they trynna scrabble your words like/
						If ya dicks in a hole are you really in this cockpit? How is change gon come if you fuckin with what&#39;s constant? Everybody opinions, everyone in ya friendlist, everybody&#39;s a business cuz everybody&#39;s a witness and everybody&#39;s a witness cuz you a bit more poetic and it might drive you towards the cliff you probably jump out the edge//
						And it&#39;s a shame you couldn&#39;t edge it, but the lane I&#39;m on is endless and ya favourite cars are Benz&#39;s but ya soul is really helpless// My brain, My heart and spirits got a flame, a spark, a message and the dreams I chase are epic/ while you just chasin trends its/ a blessing to blend in, connect with the masses and if you don&#39;t hear me, your ears peep through whack shit//
						Cant pierce deep through my tracklist, I&#39;m knee deep, you cant stand shit, I 3-Peat on these baskets, now sleep deep in your casket//
						Cuz I&#39;m bout to explode the moment I go and I talk to my soul and I probably told you a thousand times over that Ima ride for ya but you took to rocket and blasted// So this is the genesis and you my nemesis, Me against Me, that&#39;s what the premise is, Me and the fellowship, we here developin/ Best in the biz, fuck all of ya records/ Jump off of the pedestal, efforts are miniscule, this is a blessing, guess I&#39;m a miracle, I&#39;m killin beats, I&#39;m really Me/ PJ 2 to the 3, I&#39;m killin you, you feelin Me/ lyrically, I&#39;m the villain b, these questions set Me free, watch me BLEED//
						</p>

						<br /><br />

						<h2>Hook 2:</h2><br />
						<p>They&#39;re out here to watch you crumble/
						Swear to God we make this city Bleed//
